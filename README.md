# Vehicle Management System

The function of the production code is to develop a system that will efficiently manage a fleet of autonomous vehicles and
support real-time queries about vehicle status and location. The user can provide
locations and create paths between those locations to create road networks. And
user is able to deploy or remove vehicle from that road network as well as manipulate
vehicle data.
The program will give recommendations to the user based on the battery level of a
vehicle and the vehicles distance to its destination.
